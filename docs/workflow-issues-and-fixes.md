## Detailed Issues & Proposed Solutions

---

### Issue 1: `issues: labeled` trigger is commented out in workflow YAML

**Status:** Complete

**Remarks:**

I added this already. Verify and mark completed. Add a condition to run a "skip" job which outputs the matching event and event data and explains it is explicitly ignored so the orchestration agent will skip running. We can add ignored conditions here cumulatively to the if: statement for cases we want to skip running the orchestration agent.

**Location:** `.github/workflows/orchestrator-agent.yml`, line 4

**Description:**
The orchestrator workflow only triggers on `issues: [opened]`. The `labeled` event type is commented out. However, the orchestrator prompt's match clauses rely heavily on `labeled` events:

- `case (action = labeled && labels contains: "implementation:ready" && title contains: "Complete Implementation")` — drives the Epic cascade
- `case (action = labeled && labels contains: "implementation:ready" && title contains: "Epic")` — drives Epic implementation
- `case (action = labeled && labels contains: "implementation:complete" && title contains: "Epic")` — drives next-Epic creation

**Impact:** The entire self-bootstrapping cascade (Epic creation → Epic implementation → next Epic) **cannot function**. The orchestrator can only react to issue opens and workflow_run completions.

**Proposed Solutions:**

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| **A (Recommended)** | Uncomment `labeled` in the issues trigger: `types: [opened, labeled]` | Enables full cascade; minimal change | May trigger on unrelated label additions; needs guard logic in prompt |
| B | Add a separate workflow for label events with its own filter | Separation of concerns | More files to maintain; duplicates infra |
| C | Switch to `issue_comment` dispatch model (agent posts command comments) | Avoids label-trigger noise | Requires rewriting all prompt clauses; bigger refactor |

**Recommended fix:**

```yaml
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, labeled]
```

Add a condition in the job to skip runs for labels that aren't workflow-relevant (e.g., only proceed if the label is `implementation:ready` or `implementation:complete`).

---

### Issue 2: Template `.labels.json` missing all `agent:*` and workflow labels

**Status:** Complete

**Remarks:**

Implement A as recommended. Additionally add more prevalent directions with the path to the .labels.json file to reduce the probability of agents missing it.

**Location:** `.github/.labels.json`

**Description:**
The template's labels file is a snapshot from `nam20485/AgentAsAService` and contains only 15 labels (GitHub defaults + `assigned`, `state:*`, `type:enhancement`). It is missing the OS-APOW workflow labels that the orchestrator state machine depends on:

**Missing labels:**
- `agent:queued` — Tasks waiting for agent
- `agent:in-progress` — Tasks being processed by agent
- `agent:success` — Successfully completed tasks
- `agent:error` — Tasks that failed
- `agent:infra-failure` — Infrastructure failures
- `agent:stalled-budget` — Budget exceeded (deferred)
- `implementation:complete` — Marks completed epics
- `epic` — Epic-level issues
- `story` — Story-level issues

**Evidence:** foxtrot54 repo has 24 labels (agent added them during project-setup). yankee89-b has only 17 (agent did NOT add them → broken state machine).

**Proposed Solutions:**

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| **A (Recommended)** | Add all required labels to `.github/.labels.json` in the template | Every new repo starts correct; single source of truth | Must keep in sync with orchestrator prompt |
| B | Have `import-labels.ps1` merge from a second "workflow-labels.json" file | Separates base labels from workflow labels | Two files to manage |
| C | Have the project-setup workflow create labels via `gh label create` on the fly | No template change needed | Non-deterministic; varies per run |

**Recommended fix:** Add the following entries to `.github/.labels.json`:

```json
{"name": "agent:queued",       "color": "0e8a16", "description": "Tasks waiting for agent"},
{"name": "agent:in-progress",  "color": "fbca04", "description": "Tasks being processed by agent"},
{"name": "agent:success",      "color": "0e8a16", "description": "Successfully completed tasks"},
{"name": "agent:error",        "color": "d73a4a", "description": "Tasks that failed"},
{"name": "agent:infra-failure","color": "b60205", "description": "Infrastructure failures"},
{"name": "agent:stalled-budget","color": "e99695","description": "Budget limit reached"},
{"name": "implementation:complete","color":"0e8a16","description":"Implementation completed"},
{"name": "epic",               "color": "3E4B9E", "description": "Epic-level issues"},
{"name": "story",              "color": "7057ff", "description": "Story-level issues"}
```

Also remove the stale `id`, `node_id`, and `url` fields that point to `nam20485/AgentAsAService` — `import-labels.ps1` only needs `name`, `color`, and `description`.

---

### Issue 3: No PR created in yankee89-b despite 1h12m orchestrator run

**Status:** Complete

**Remarks:**

Implement A as recommended.

**Location:** yankee89-b repository — 0 open/closed PRs

**Description:**
The orchestrator-agent #2 ran for 1h 12m 47s and completed successfully, but the repo has 0 pull requests. The workflow plan specifies that `init-existing-repository` (Assignment 1) should create a `dynamic-workflow-project-setup` branch and a PR.

The orchestrator ran due to the `workflow_run` trigger (prebuild devcontainer completed), entered the `project-setup` dynamic workflow, but the agent appears to have only produced a workflow plan document (`plan_docs/workflow-plan.md`) without proceeding to actual repo initialization.

**Proposed Solutions:**

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| **A (Recommended)** | Fix the project-setup workflow to explicitly create the branch and PR as its first action, before proceeding to planning docs | Ensures critical infra is created early | Requires workflow script update |
| B | Add pre-flight validation in orchestrator that checks for branch/PR existence after each assignment | Catches failures; enables retry | More complex; post-hoc |
| C | Make `init-existing-repository` a mandatory non-skippable step with explicit failure if PR creation fails | Hard guarantee | May block other assignments |

**Root cause hypothesis:** The agent created the workflow plan but either (a) hit an error during PR creation that it silently swallowed, or (b) the `project-setup` workflow's `init-existing-repository` assignment was never reached because the orchestrator interpreted the `workflow_run` event data and stopped after the planning step.

**Recommended:** Investigate the full orchestrator agent log (requires authenticated access to Actions run #2). Also ensure the project-setup workflow has explicit "create PR" steps with error handling that surfaces failures.

---

### Issue 4: No GitHub Project created in yankee89-b

**Status:** Complete

**Remarks:**

trigger-project-setup.ps1 I commented out because the timing didn't work. At the end of create-repo-from-plan-docs.ps1 the docker and devcontainer images haven't had time to build yet so orchestration doesn't work. It just ends up calling orchestrate-agent workflow which errors out. Create the create-project.ps1 script but after that only add directions in the existing workflow explaining how to use it and then increase the visibility of the directions to use it to create the project in order to reduce the possibility it's missed.

**Location:** yankee89-b repository — 0 projects

**Description:**
The workflow plan's Assignment 1 (`init-existing-repository`) specifies creating a GitHub Project (Board template) linked to the repository with columns: Not Started, In Progress, In Review, Done. No project exists.

Contrast with foxtrot54 which successfully created a project: "workflow-orchestration-queue-foxtrot54" (org project #6).

**Proposed Solutions:**

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| **A (Recommended)** | Add project creation as a scripted step in `trigger-project-setup.ps1` or a new `create-project.ps1` script | Deterministic; runs outside agent | Requires API permissions (org:project scope) |
| B | Keep it as an agent task but add explicit retry + validation | Agent handles it; less scripting | Subject to agent hallucination/failure |
| C | Make project creation a separate workflow step (GitHub Action) that runs before the orchestrator | Guaranteed by CI | More workflow complexity |

**Recommended:** Create a `scripts/create-project.ps1` that uses `gh project create` and `gh project link` with proper error handling. Call it from `trigger-project-setup.ps1`.

---

### Issue 5: Label set incomplete in yankee89-b (17 vs 24 needed)

**Status:** Complete


**Remarks:** Issue 2 fix will be sufficient, as explained.

**Location:** yankee89-b labels page

**Description:**
yankee89-b has 17 labels. foxtrot54 has 24 labels. The difference includes the `agent:*` state machine labels and `epic`/`story` taxonomy labels. The orchestrator cannot transition issues through the state machine without these labels.

**Current yankee89-b labels (17):** `assigned`, `assigned:copilot`, `bug`, `documentation`, `duplicate`, `enhancement`, `good first issue`, `help wanted`, `implementation:ready`, `invalid`, `planning`, `question`, `state`, `state:in-progress`, `state:planning`, `type:enhancement`, `wontfix`

**Missing (needed):** `agent:queued`, `agent:in-progress`, `agent:success`, `agent:error`, `agent:infra-failure`, `epic`, `story`

**This is a direct consequence of Issue 2** (template `.labels.json` incomplete). See Issue 2 for fix.

**Additional fix needed for yankee89-b specifically:** Run `import-labels.ps1` against the repo after updating `.labels.json`, or manually create the missing labels.

### Issue 6: Sentinel claim markers block reclaim after restart

**Status:** Deferred

**Remarks:**

Leave not started — this will be resolved in the implementation phase (which hasn't started yet).

**Location:** `src/osapow/sentinel/orchestrator.py` (foxtrot54 codebase, produced by project-setup)

**Description:**
Per Codex review: `_cleanup()` now requeues the active task back to `agent:queued` on shutdown, but `GitHubQueue.claim_task()` still treats another sentinel's `<!-- sentinel-claim: ... -->` comment as authoritative until `claim_stale_timeout_secs` expires (30 minutes by default). Because `main()` generates a new sentinel ID on every restart, the replacement process will refuse to reclaim the just-requeued task for up to 30 minutes.

**Proposed Solutions:**

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| **A (Recommended)** | On shutdown, delete the sentinel claim comment (or edit it to mark it expired) in addition to requeuing | Clean state on restart | Extra API call during shutdown |
| B | Allow sentinels to claim tasks even with existing claim markers if the task has `agent:queued` label | Faster recovery | Risk of dual-claim if cleanup races |
| C | Use a persistent sentinel ID (stored in a file or env var) so restarts reuse the same ID | Avoids the problem entirely | Adds state management complexity |

---

### Issue 7: `SENTINEL_BOT_LOGIN` not validated at startup

**Status:** Deferred


**Remarks:**

Leave not started — this will be resolved in the implementation phase (which hasn't started yet).

**Location:** `src/osapow/sentinel/orchestrator.py`, `main()` function

**Description:**
Per Codex review: `main()` only validates `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_ORG`, and `GITHUB_REPO` before constructing the orchestrator. If `SENTINEL_BOT_LOGIN` is blank, `GitHubQueue.claim_task()` skips the entire assign-and-verify branch (`if bot_login:`), allowing multiple sentinel processes to label-claim and execute the same queued issue in parallel.

**Proposed Solutions:**

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| **A (Recommended)** | Add `SENTINEL_BOT_LOGIN` to the required env var check and `sys.exit(1)` if missing | Fail-fast; prevents silent dual-execution | Breaking change if some deployments don't set it |
| B | Default to the authenticated user's login via `gh api /user` | Auto-discovers; no config needed | Extra API call; may fail |

---

### Issue 8: Incomplete label cleanup during requeue

**Status:** Deferred

**Remarks:**

Leave not started — this will be resolved in the implementation phase (which hasn't started yet).

**Location:** `src/osapow/queue/github_queue.py`, `requeue_with_feedback()`

**Description:**
Per Codex review: `handle_github_webhook()` sends retries from `agent:reconciling`, `agent:infra-failure`, and `agent:stalled-budget` into `requeue_with_feedback()`, but this helper only deletes `agent:success`, `agent:error`, and `agent:in-progress`. Requeueing from any of the other states leaves `agent:queued` alongside the old terminal label, creating contradictory state.

**Proposed Solutions:**

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| **A (Recommended)** | Add all `agent:*` labels to the cleanup list in `requeue_with_feedback()` | Complete cleanup; consistent state | None significant |
| B | Create a `remove_all_agent_labels()` helper called by all state transitions | DRY; used everywhere | Slightly more refactoring |

---

### Issue 9: `GITHUB_TOKEN` not validated in notifier `create_app()`

**Status:** Deferred

**Remarks:**

Leave not started — this will be resolved in the implementation phase (which hasn't started yet).

**Location:** `src/osapow/notifier/service.py`, `create_app()` function

**Description:**
Per Codex review: `create_app()` always constructs `GitHubQueue` from `os.environ.get("GITHUB_TOKEN", "")`, and the health endpoint stays green even when that value is empty. The notifier accepts and verifies webhooks but every later call to `add_to_queue()` / `requeue_with_feedback()` fails at runtime.

**Recommended fix:** Validate `GITHUB_TOKEN` is non-empty at app startup; return a degraded health status if not configured.

---

### Issue 10: Docker COPY order breaks editable install

**Status:** Complete

**Remarks:**

Implement recommended solution.

**Location:** `Dockerfile`

**Description:**
Per Codex review: `COPY src/ ./src/` must come before `uv pip install -e .` for the editable install to find the package source.

**Recommended fix:** Reorder Dockerfile to COPY source before install.

---

### Issue 11: Healthcheck uses `curl` instead of Python

**Status:** Complete

**Remarks:**

Implement recommended solution.

**Location:** `docker-compose.yml`

**Description:**
Per Codex review: The container doesn't include `curl`. Use a Python-based urllib healthcheck instead: `python -c "import urllib.request; urllib.request.urlopen('http://localhost:8000/health')"`.

**Recommended fix:** Replace `curl` healthcheck with Python-based check.

---

### Issue 12: `verify_signature()` silent on missing WEBHOOK_SECRET

**Status:** Deferred

**Remarks:**

Leave not started — this will be resolved in the implementation phase (which hasn't started yet).

**Location:** `src/osapow/notifier/service.py`

**Description:**
Per Codex review: If `WEBHOOK_SECRET` is not configured, signature verification silently passes, allowing any payload to be accepted.

**Recommended fix:** Raise an error or return 500 if `WEBHOOK_SECRET` is not set when a webhook arrives with an `X-Hub-Signature-256` header.

---

### Issue 13: Missing `issue_comment.created` action handling

**Status:** Deferred

**Remarks:**

Leave not started — this isn't needed yet. What action would we need for issue_comment.created?

**Location:** `src/osapow/notifier/service.py`

**Description:**
Per Codex review: The webhook handler didn't handle the `created` action for `issue_comment` events, only `edited`.

**Recommended fix:** Add `created` to the handled actions for `issue_comment`.

---

### Issue 14: Missing `pull_request_review` event support

**Status:** Deferred

**Remarks:**

Leave not started — this isn't needed yet. What action would we need for pull_request_review?

**Location:** `src/osapow/notifier/service.py`

**Description:**
Per Codex review: `pull_request_review` events (submitted, edited) were not handled by the webhook receiver.

**Recommended fix:** Add `pull_request_review` event type handling.

---

### Issue 15: `pyproject.toml` entry point uses async — needs sync wrapper

**Status:** Deferred

**Remarks:**

Leave not started — this isn't needed yet.

**Location:** `pyproject.toml`

**Description:**
Per Codex review: Console script entry points must be synchronous functions. The entry point was pointing to an async function.

**Recommended fix:** Create a `run_main()` synchronous wrapper that calls `asyncio.run(main())` and point the entry point there.

---

### Issue 23: Bootstrap PR NOTE clause causes model confusion at epic review stage

**Status:** Open

**Forensic Source:** `intel-agency/workflow-orchestration-queue-india87` — workflow run [23815130143](https://github.com/intel-agency/workflow-orchestration-queue-india87/actions/runs/23815130143) (27m58s, reported "succeeded")

**Regression Commit:** `d4b5f28` — "docs: add note to skip PR review for already-merged bootstrap PRs in epic workflow" (2026-03-29)

**Location:** `.github/workflows/prompts/orchestrator-agent-prompt.md` lines 212-216

**Description:**
A 6-line NOTE was added to the `orchestration:epic-implemented` clause advising the model to check for already-merged bootstrap PRs before invoking `review-epic-prs`. In india87, the model reads this NOTE and enters a prolonged deliberation loop:

1. **19:20:06** — Sequential thinking finalizes plan: check for merged PRs, then decide
2. **19:20:36** — Delegates to github-expert, which correctly finds 0 merged PRs and 1 open PR (#4)
3. **19:21:23** — Model reads the NOTE and deliberates: "This is Phase 0, Task 0.1 - the bootstrap task. However... no merged PRs... But wait - this is a template repo... The work for Phase 0 was likely done as part of the template creation process itself, not through a PR... maybe the right approach is to check if there's evidence the work was completed..."
4. **19:22:00+** — Instead of invoking `review-epic-prs`, the model generates **400+ lines of rambling pseudo-code** that never executes actual tool calls
5. **19:25:39** — Model outputs `gh issue edit 3 --add-label "orchestration:epic-reviewed"` as **text** — not as a tool call. Never executed.
6. **19:39:28** — Output degrades into Chinese characters (GLM base language leaking through)

**Compounding factors:**
- ZhipuAI GLM-5 API returned HTTP 500 errors 3 times during this run (error code 1234, "Network error" from api.z.ai), at 19:22:00, 19:22:33, and 19:23:08. Each cost ~31s of execution time.
- After API recovery, the model's output quality degrades significantly, producing rambling text instead of tool calls.
- The workflow run reports exit code 0 ("succeeded") due to the exit-code-masking issue (P21), hiding the fact that no work was completed.

**Impact:** PR #4 remains OPEN and NOT MERGED. Issue #3 never receives the `orchestration:epic-reviewed` label. The 4-step epic pipeline is stuck — no forward progress possible.

**Evidence from india87 run logs (run 23815130143):**
- Issue #3 comment at 19:24:03: "Step 2/4: Starting review-epic-prs" — but review never actually executed
- PR #4 has a single external comment from chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]: "You have reached your Codex usage limits for code reviews" — irrelevant to the failure
- Only 2 commits exist on main (initial + seed) — no epic code was ever merged

**Why this is a regression:** Before commit `d4b5f28`, the model would simply invoke `review-epic-prs` for any open PR without deliberating about bootstrap edge cases. The NOTE created a decision fork that GLM-5 cannot reliably navigate, especially under API instability.

**Proposed fix:**

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| **A (Recommended)** | Remove the 6-line NOTE entirely (revert `d4b5f28`). The model already checks `gh pr list --state merged` naturally. | Eliminates deliberation loop; simplest fix; restores known-working behavior | Loses the explicit skip-if-merged guidance |
| B | Replace 6-line NOTE with single-line directive: `## If a merged PR already covers this epic, skip review-epic-prs and apply the success label.` | Retains guidance without verbose deliberation trigger | Still a decision fork; may cause similar issues |
| C | Move the merged-PR check into the `/orchestrate-dynamic-workflow` command itself rather than the orchestrator prompt | Keeps prompt simple; pushes logic to the workflow | Requires changes to remote workflow assignment |

---

### Issue 24: ZhipuAI GLM-5 API instability — repeated HTTP 500s during subagent execution

**Status:** Open (external dependency)

**Forensic Source:** `intel-agency/workflow-orchestration-queue-india87` — workflow run [23815130143](https://github.com/intel-agency/workflow-orchestration-queue-india87/actions/runs/23815130143)

**Location:** External — ZhipuAI API (`api.z.ai`)

**Description:**
During the india87 review-epic-prs run, the github-expert subagent received 3 separate HTTP 500 errors from `api.z.ai`, each with error code 1234 ("Network error, please contact customer service"). The errors occurred at:
- 19:22:00 (+32.3s API timeout)
- 19:22:33 (+31.3s API timeout)
- 19:23:08 (+31.0s API timeout)

After each recovery, the model's output quality degrades: responses become increasingly incoherent, tool calls are replaced by textual pseudo-code that never executes, and eventually the output includes Chinese characters from the GLM base model's training language.

**Impact:** The github-expert subagent burned ~27 minutes of execution time without completing any actual work. The PR was never reviewed, never merged, and the label was never applied.

**Mitigation options:**

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| **A** | Configure opencode model fallback chain (GLM-5 → Kimi K2 → GPT-5.4) | Automatic recovery from provider outages | Requires opencode support for fallback; models may behave differently |
| B | Add retry-with-backoff logic in `run_opencode_prompt.sh` at the workflow level | Simple to implement; provider-agnostic | Only retries the full run, not individual API calls |
| C | Monitor ZhipuAI API health pre-flight; skip run if API is degraded | Avoids wasting runner time on doomed runs | Requires health-check endpoint; adds latency |

### Issue 16: Traycerai bot edits trigger redundant orchestrator runs

**Status:** Complete

**Remarks:**

Add this case to the "skip" job explained in Issue 1.

**Location:** yankee89-b Actions tab

**Description:**
Orchestrator-agent runs #3-#6 were triggered by `traycerai` bot editing its comment on Issue #1. Each edit re-triggers the `issue_comment` workflow (if enabled), causing redundant runs.

**Proposed Solutions:**

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| **A (Recommended)** | Add `if: github.actor != 'traycerai[bot]'` condition to the workflow job | Prevents bot loops | Must maintain actor exclusion list |
| B | Ignore `edited` events for `issue_comment`, only react to `created` | Reduces noise | May miss legitimate edits |

---

### Issue 17: `.labels.json` URLs point to `nam20485/AgentAsAService`

**Status:** Complete

**Remarks:**

Fix.

**Location:** `.github/.labels.json`

**Description:**
The labels file was exported from a different repo (`nam20485/AgentAsAService`). The `id`, `node_id`, and `url` fields reference that repo. While `import-labels.ps1` only uses `name`, `color`, and `description`, the stale metadata is confusing.

**Recommended fix:** Strip `id`, `node_id`, and `url` fields from `.labels.json`, keeping only `name`, `color`, and `description`.

---

### Issue 18: Concurrent delegation artificially limited to 2 in orchestrator prompt

**Status:** Complete
**Remarks:** Fixed in commit `bc4126c`. Validated in delta86 logs (model still echoes old behavior on pre-fix repos seeded before the fix).

Remove depth constraints as well. Leave no artificial constraints on orchestrator's delegations.

**Location:** `.opencode/agents/orchestrator.md`, `AGENTS.md`

**Description:**
The orchestrator agent was explicitly told to limit concurrent delegations to 2 in three places:
1. `.opencode/agents/orchestrator.md` step 5: `Build delegation tree (≤2 concurrent)`
2. `.opencode/agents/orchestrator.md` Delegation Depth Management: `Concurrent delegation limit: Maximum 2 concurrent delegations`
3. `AGENTS.md` coding conventions: `Keep orchestrator delegation-depth ≤2`

This is a prompt-level constraint only — opencode supports parallel Task tool calls natively with no hard limit. The model was obeying the instruction literally, serializing independent tasks unnecessarily.

Log evidence (delta86):

```
Let me delegate these tasks. I can delegate up to 2 tasks concurrently.
• Update .labels.json with agent labels  →  Developer Agent
• Create GitHub Project for tracking     →  Github-Expert Agent
```

**Fix applied:** Removed all three concurrent-limit references. The depth limit (max 2 nesting levels) is preserved since that controls nesting depth, not parallelism.

### Issue 19: GitHub Project creation blocked — missing `project` OAuth scope

**Status:** Complete
**Remarks:** Fixed in commit `7f835c0`. `projects: write` added to workflow permissions; `GH_ORCHESTRATION_AGENT_TOKEN` PAT must also have the `project` scope (verify via `gh auth refresh -h github.com -s project`).

I believe the GH_ORCHESTRATION_AGENT_TOKEN already has this scope. Verify that it's used in this process.

**Location:** `.github/workflows/orchestrator-agent.yml` permissions block; `GH_ORCHESTRATION_AGENT_TOKEN` PAT settings

**Description:**
GitHub Projects V2 uses the GraphQL API, which requires the `project` OAuth scope. The workflow permissions block was missing `projects: write`. Additionally, the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot manage Projects V2 at all — only a classic PAT with the `project` scope can.

Log evidence (delta86):

```
Github-Expert: "GITHUB_TOKEN doesn't have permission to create projects"
```

**Fix applied:** Added `projects: write` to the `orchestrator-agent.yml` permissions block.

### Issue 20: Agent incorrectly assumes project is .NET-based

**Status:** Complete
**Remarks:**

Fix.

**Location:** `create-project-structure` dynamic workflow definition (remote: `nam20485/agent-instructions`)

**Description:**
The `create-project-structure` assignment template appears to include .NET-specific examples (`.sln`, `.csproj` structure). When the orchestrator delegates this assignment for a Python/FastAPI project, subagents have explicitly noted the mismatch:

Log evidence:

```
• Execute create-project-structure  Backend-Developer Agent
Now executing Assignment 3: create-project-structure. This requires Python adaptation
as the assignment is designed for .NET.
```

This is also flagged as Open Question 6.1 in `plan_docs/workflow-plan.md`:
> *"The planning documents describe a Python/FastAPI system, but `create-project-structure` assignment mentions .NET solution structure in its example."*

**Proposed Solutions:**

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| **A (Recommended)** | Update the `create-project-structure` dynamic workflow in `agent-instructions` repo to be tech-stack-agnostic, reading the tech stack from planning docs | Correct for all future repos | Requires updating remote canonical workflow |
| B | Add a note in the assignment prompt that the .NET example is illustrative and agents must adapt to the actual tech stack | Low effort | Relies on agent correctly interpreting the note |
| C | Create a separate `create-project-structure-python` workflow variant | Tailored | Proliferates workflow variants |

### Issue 21: Orchestrator idle-kill exits code 0, masking failures; no SIGKILL escalation

**Status:** Complete
**Remarks:** Fixed in commit `cafd0b0`. End-to-end validated in yankee89-a (run 23352743760, exit code 0, 7/7 assignments completed).

**Location:** `scripts/devcontainer-opencode.sh` (watchdog / wrapper logic)

**Description:**
Three related infrastructure bugs:
1. **Exit code masking:** Idle-killed runs exited 0, making GitHub Actions report "succeeded" despite incomplete work.
2. **`::warning::` → `::error::`:** Idle kills and hard-ceiling kills are failures — were annotated as `::warning::` so they didn't surface prominently in the workflow summary.
3. **No SIGTERM→SIGKILL escalation:** After sending SIGTERM, the wrapper didn't follow up with SIGKILL if the process failed to exit, allowing zombie/hung processes.

Log evidence (india42):

```
Warning: opencode idle for 15m (no output from client or server); terminating
opencode exit code: 143                     ← SIGTERM received
Notice: devcontainer-opencode.sh exited with code: 0   ← BUG: should be non-zero
```

**Fix applied:** (a) Wrapper now exits 1 when watchdog fires. (b) Idle/ceiling kills annotated as `::error::`. (c) Sends SIGKILL after 10s if process hasn't exited following SIGTERM.

### Issue 22: Watchdog race condition — premature idle-kill during active subagent work

**Status:** Complete
**Remarks:** Fixed in commit `5d89c97`. End-to-end validated in yankee89-a (run 23352743760): watchdog survived 225s and 292s client-idle periods across 7 delegations without premature kills.

**Location:** `scripts/devcontainer-opencode.sh` (watchdog loop)

**Description:**
Race condition in the watchdog loop. When checking server activity via `/proc/<pid>/io write_bytes`, a single 30-second interval where `write_bytes` didn't change caused `server_io_active` to flip to `false`. The fallback used `server_log_idle` (mtime of `/tmp/opencode-serve.log`), which only reflected server **startup** time — not last activity. So `server_idle` jumped from 0 to the full runtime (~950s), immediately triggering the 15m idle kill even though the server was actively working 30 seconds earlier.

Log evidence (india42 — buggy behavior):

```
11:44:44 [watchdog] client output idle 886s, server I/O active (write_bytes=146317312) — subagent likely running
11:45:14 Warning: opencode idle for 15m (no output from client or server); terminating
```

Server I/O was active at 11:44:44. One 30s check later, write_bytes didn't change → `server_idle` jumped to ~952s → killed prematurely.

**Why golf43 succeeded (golden run):** Same code, same template. golf43 ran 1h 4m and completed all tasks. It never had a 30-second I/O gap at a moment when client output idle exceeded 15m — timing-dependent race condition.

**Fix applied:** Track `_last_server_io_time` (timestamp of last observed I/O activity) instead of falling back to server log mtime. The process is only killed when server I/O has been truly inactive for a full 15 minutes since it was last observed.
